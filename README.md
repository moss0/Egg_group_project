## Abstract *(Approx. 5–10% of word count | 100–300 words)*

Summarise your task, goals, approach, and final outcome. What was the intent of your work? What is the most important thing to know before reading on?

The task was to create a game themed around the topic: egg, using the Unity Engine and writing scripts in C#

My goal is to create a 3 Dimensional platforming game that revolves around getting an egg, which is controlled by the player, to the end of a handful of obstacle courses with a number of bugs as close to zero as possible.

I decided to keep the project at a realistic scope and decided upon four levels seeing as I was working alone in what was supposed to be a two person group.

I feel as though I achieved the objective I set and perhaps a little extra. The project shows that I have a decent foundation of knowledge in regards to the Unity Engine and C# although there are some concepts I have not used such as Inheritance.

## Research *(Approx. 20-30% of word count)*

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

Reflect on the **type** and **relevance** of sources explored. Justify your research direction in relation to the task brief and target outcomes.

* What types of sources did you explore and why?
* Which types of sources did you avoid and why?
* How does the research relate to the user experience, technical approach, or creative aim?

#### Sources

For each source, provide:

1. An **opening paragraph** describing the source's creator/publisher, reputation, and relevance.
2. A **bullet list** of what you analysed or learned from it.
3. A **closing paragraph** evaluating its usefulness or limitations.

You may include both **academic resources** and **industry examples** (e.g. documentation, games, developer talks). You are encouraged to include plenty of images, videos and diagrams.

## Implementation *(Approx. 30–40% of word count)*

### What was your development process and how did decisions evolve?

Describe your technical and creative approach, including:

* Planning, ideation, and iteration
* Feedback received and how it was integrated
* New tools, workflows, or systems explored

#### Example Code Snippet

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class HelloWorld : MonoBehaviour 
{
    public void Start() 
    {
        Debug.Log("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

*Figure 2: Example code snippet using Unity's `Start()` method.*

### What creative or technical methods did you try?

Were any methods unfamiliar or experimental? Did they succeed? Did they change your approach?

### Did you experience any technical challenges?

How did you address problems, bugs, or limitations?

## Testing *(Approx. 10–15% of word count)*

### What testing methods did you use?

* Did you conduct internal testing, peer testing, or user testing?
* What were your key goals in testing?
* What did you observe or learn from testing?
* How did testing influence the final result?

You may include screenshots, graphs, tables, or embedded videos to demonstrate tests and results.

## Bibliography

Please use [UCA's Harvard Referencing Format](https://mylibrary.uca.ac.uk/referencing) for all citations.

Example:

> Rollings, A. and Adams, E. (2003) *Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design*. New Riders Publishing.

## Declared Assets

You must declare any content that was **not entirely created by you**, or was **modified with the aid of AI tools**. This includes:

* Third-party 3D models, audio, textures, or code
* Code snippets from tutorials or forums
* AI-generated or AI-assisted assets (e.g. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, DALL·E)

List these clearly, with context where needed.

Example:

> The following assets were created or modified with the use of GPT-4o:
>
> * `Test.cs` – generated structure with manual revision
> * `UIAudioManager.cs` – refactored with Copilot suggestions
> * `DevelopmentJournal.html` – generated layout and headings

## Tips for Success

* Use plenty of **images, code snippets, drawn diagrams, tables and embedded media** to support your writing.
* Use **inline citations** for everything that influenced your work, including software and games. Include as many **hyperlinks** as possible for easier navigation to external sources.
* Reference **documentation, tutorials**, and **games** just like academic sources.
* Word count is a guideline – ±10% is allowed.
* You are allowed to use AI tools, but you **must declare** them under *Declared Assets*.
